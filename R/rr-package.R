#' R Package for the Randomized Response Technique
#' 
#' \code{rr} implements methods developed by Blair, Imai, and Zhou (2015) such
#' as multivariate regression and power analysis for the randomized response
#' technique. Randomized response is a survey technique that introduces random
#' noise to reduce potential bias from non-response and social desirability
#' when asking questions about sensitive behaviors and beliefs. The current
#' version of this package conducts multivariate regression analyses for the
#' sensitive item under four standard randomized response designs: mirrored
#' question, forced response, disguised response, and unrelated question.
#' Second, it generates predicted probabilities of answering affirmatively to
#' the sensitive item for each respondent. Third, it also allows users to use
#' the sensitive item as a predictor in an outcome regression under the forced
#' response design. Additionally, it implements power analyses to help improve
#' research design. In future versions, this package will extend to new
#' modified designs that are based on less stringent assumptions than those of
#' the standard designs, specifically to allow for non-compliance and unknown
#' distribution to the unrelated question under the unrelated question design.
