\usage{
rrreg(formula, p, p0, p1, q, design, data, start = NULL, maxIter =
10000, verbose = FALSE, optim = FALSE, em.converge = 10^(-8), glmMaxIter =
10000, solve.tolerance = .Machine$double.eps)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{An object of class "formula": a symbolic description of the
model to be fitted.}

\item{p}{The probability of receiving the sensitive question (Mirrored
Question Design, Unrelated Question Design); the probability of answering
truthfully (Forced Response Design); the probability of selecting a red card
from the 'yes' stack (Disguised Response Design). For "mirrored" and
"disguised" designs, p cannot equal .5.}

\item{p0}{The probability of forced 'no' (Forced Response Design).}

\item{p1}{The probability of forced 'yes' (Forced Response Design).}

\item{q}{The probability of answering 'yes' to the unrelated question, which
is assumed to be independent of covariates (Unrelated Question Design).}

\item{design}{One of the four standard designs: "forced-known", "mirrored",
"disguised", or "unrelated-known".}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables in the model.}

\item{start}{Optional starting values of coefficient estimates for the
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.}

\item{maxIter}{Maximum number of iterations for the Expectation-Maximization
algorithm. The default is \code{10000}.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value indicating whether model diagnostics counting
the number of EM iterations are printed out.  The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{optim}{A logical value indicating whether to use the quasi-Newton
"BFGS" method to calculate the variance-covariance matrix and standard
errors. The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{em.converge}{A value specifying the satisfactory degree of convergence
under the EM algorithm. The default is \code{10^(-8)}.}

\item{glmMaxIter}{A value specifying the maximum number of iterations to run
the EM algorithm. The default is \code{10000}.}

\item{solve.tolerance}{When standard errors are calculated, this option
specifies the tolerance of the matrix inversion operation solve.}
}
\value{
\code{rrreg} returns an object of class "rrreg".  The function
\code{summary} is used to obtain a table of the results.  The object
\code{rrreg} is a list that contains the following components (the inclusion
of some components such as the design parameters are dependent upon the
design used):

\item{est}{Point estimates for the effects of covariates on the randomized
response item.} \item{vcov}{Variance-covariance matrix for the effects of
covariates on the randomized response item.} \item{se}{Standard errors for
estimates of the effects of covariates on the randomized response item.}
\item{data}{The \code{data} argument.} \item{coef.names}{Variable names as
defined in the data frame.} \item{x}{The model matrix of covariates.}
\item{y}{The randomized response vector.} \item{design}{Call of standard
design used: "forced-known", "mirrored", "disguised", or "unrelated-known".}
\item{p}{The \code{p} argument.} \item{p0}{The \code{p0} argument.}
\item{p1}{The \code{p1} argument.} \item{q}{The \code{q} argument.}
\item{call}{The matched call.}
}
\description{
\code{rrreg} is used to conduct multivariate regression analyses of survey
data using randomized response methods.
}
\details{
This function allows users to perform multivariate regression analysis on
data from the randomized response technique.  Four standard designs are
accepted by this function: mirrored question, forced response, disguised
response, and unrelated question. The method implemented by this function is
the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation for the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm.
