NULL, sig.level, prespT.seq, prespC.seq, prespT.null = NULL, prespC.null,

}
\arguments{
\item{p}{The probability of receiving the sensitive question (Mirrored
Question Design, Unrelated Question Design); the probability of answering
truthfully (Forced Response Design); the probability of selecting a red card
from the 'yes' stack (Disguised Response Design).}

\item{p0}{The probability of forced 'no' (Forced Response Design).}

\item{p1}{The probability of forced 'yes' (Forced Response Design).}

\item{q}{The probability of answering 'yes' to the unrelated question, which
is assumed to be independent of covariates (Unrelated Question Design).}

\item{design}{Call of design (including modified designs) used:
"forced-known", "mirrored", "disguised", "unrelated-known",
"forced-unknown", and "unrelated-unknown".}

\item{n.seq}{A sequence of number of observations or sample sizes.}

\item{r}{For the modified designs only (i.e. "forced-unknown" for Forced
Response with Unknown Probability and "unrelated-unknown" for Unrelated
Question with Unknown Probability), \code{r} is the proportion of
respondents allocated to the first group, which is the group that is
directed to answer the sensitive question truthfully with probability
\code{p} as opposed to the second group which is directed to answer the
sensitive question truthfully with probability \code{1-p}.}

\item{presp.seq}{For a one sample test, a sequence of probabilities of
possessing the sensitive trait under the alternative hypothesis.}

\item{presp.null}{For a one sample test, the probability of possessing the
sensitive trait under the null hypothesis. The default is \code{NULL}
meaning zero probability of possessing the sensitive trait.}

\item{sig.level}{Significance level (Type I error probability).}

\item{prespT.seq}{For a two sample test, a sequence of probabilities of the
treated group possessing the sensitive trait under the alternative
hypothesis.}

\item{prespC.seq}{For a two sample test, a sequence of probabitilies of the
control group possessing the sensitive trait under the alternative
hypothesis.}

\item{prespT.null}{For a two sample test, the probability of the treated
group possessing the sensitive trait under the null hypothesis. The default
is \code{NULL} meaning there is no difference between the treated and
control groups, specifically that \code{prespT.null} is the same as
\code{prespC.null}, the probability of the control group possessing the
sensitive trait under the null hypothesis.}

\item{prespC.null}{For a two sample test, the probability of the control
group possessing the sensitive trait under the null hypothesis.}

\item{type}{One or two sample test. For a two sample test, the alternative
and null hypotheses refer to the difference between the two samples of the
probabilities of possessing the sensitive trait.}

\item{alternative}{One or two sided test.}

\item{solve.tolerance}{When standard errors are calculated, this option
specifies the tolerance of the matrix inversion operation solve.}

\item{legend}{Indicator of whether to include a legend of sample sizes. The
default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{legend.x}{Placement on the x-axis of the legend. The default is
\code{"bottomright"}.}

\item{legend.y}{Placement on the y-axis of the legend.}

\item{par}{Option to set or query graphical parameters within the function.
The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to \code{par()}}

\description{
\code{power.rr.plot} generates a power analysis plot for randomized response
survey designs.
}
\details{
This function generates a power analysis plot for randomized response survey
designs, both for the standard designs ("forced-known", "mirrored",
"disguised", "unrelated-known") and modified designs ("forced-unknown", and
"unrelated -unknown"). The x-axis shows the population proportions with the
sensitive trait; the y-axis shows the statistical power; and different
sample sizes are shown as different lines in grayscale.

\dontrun{
## Generate a power plot for the forced design with known 
## probabilities of 2/3 in truth-telling group, 1/6 forced to say "yes" 
## and 1/6 forced to say "no", varying the number of respondents from

## possessing the sensitive trait from 0 to .15.
